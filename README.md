# Image-Encryption-using-AES-and-Shuffling
This is my Cryptography and Network Security Project in which image encryption is done using AES and modified shuffling method.
Also TCP socket connection is implemented here so that client1 can send the encrypted file to client2 which then decrypt the same.
